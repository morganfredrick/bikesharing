## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a proposal to investors for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa, based on data from the Citi Bike-Share service in New York City, New York. From the dataset, we were able to create visualizations to show average bike usage duration trends, relationships between gender and popular biking times, and top start and drop off locations. Specifically, this set of visualizations: 

* Shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Shows the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each weekday
* Shows the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each weekday

## Results
The visualization results of the analysis are shown below:

## Summary
Based on the analysis, we can infer that many of these users may not be tourists, but rather work commuters as most of the peak times are around morning and evening weekday work commute times. The data concludes that the majority of the users were male riders with annual subscriptions, which may be beneficial information for future ad campaigns. Another significant point that can be made is that most of the ride durations peaked at around 5 minutes and user numbers significantly dropped off after 20 minutes, concluding that they are using the services for short rides within the city. If there were to be a bike-sharing program set up in Des Moines, it would be beneficial for each station to be set up within approximately 5-10 minutes of biking distance from each other, based on the data for the average usage duration. When deciding how many stations to be setting up and how many bikes to provide within the service, population and vehicle ownership need to be taken into consideration, as most NYC residents do not own vehicles and rely on bike-share services, car services, and public transportation to get around the city, which may not be the case with Des Moines residents.
